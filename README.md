## <a name=intro>Introduction</a>
An unofficial PowerShell module that provides cmdlets for performing commands against the OVH API.

This module exists solely for as a means for me to learn PowerShell modules. It should not be taken as a replacement for any official OVH API modules or any other, likely better, repos that already provide PowerShell cmdlets for interacting with the OVH API. It will likely never be finished and will likely only receive commands that I personally use against OVH. That all said, if you find it useful then great-feel free to do whatever you need to do with it. Most of the logic used has been cribbed from the official OVH python module
